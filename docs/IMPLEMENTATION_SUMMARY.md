# Authentication & Role-Based Access Control - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

A complete authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) system has been added to the City Data Manager application.

## System Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```
User → Login Page → Authenticate → Session Created → Redirect to Home
                                        ↓
                                   PostgreSQL
                                   (users table)
```

### Authorization Flow
```
Request → Check Session → Check Role → Allow/Deny → Response
              ↓               ↓
          isAuthenticated  hasRole()
```

## Components Added

### 1. Database Tables

**users table:**
```sql
- id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- username (TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL)
- password (TEXT NOT NULL - hashed)
- role (TEXT - 'Admin', 'Editor', or 'Viewer')
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

**session table:**
- Automatically managed by express-session
- Stores session data in PostgreSQL

### 2. Backend (server.js)

**Middleware:**
- `isAuthenticated` - Checks if user has valid session
- `hasRole(roles)` - Checks if user has required role

**Authentication Routes:**
- `GET /login` - Serve login page
- `POST /login` - Process login, create session
- `GET /logout` - Destroy session, redirect to login
- `GET /api/user-info` - Get current user info

**Admin Routes (Admin only):**
- `GET /api/users` - List all users
- `POST /api/users/create` - Create new user
- `POST /api/users/:id/role` - Change user role
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user

**Protected Data Routes:**
- `POST /add` - Editor & Admin only
- `POST /upload` - Editor & Admin only
- `POST /edit/:id` - Editor & Admin only
- `POST /delete/:id` - Editor & Admin only
- `GET /admin-dashboard` - Admin only

### 3. Frontend Pages

**login.html**
- Beautiful login form with gradient background
- Error handling and validation
- Responsive design

**admin-dashboard.html**
- Create new users
- View all users with roles
- Change user roles
- Delete users
- Real-time user count
- Role badges with color coding

**Updated Pages:**
- `index.html` - Added user info display, role-based UI, logout
- `all.html` - Added user info display, role-based edit/delete controls

### 4. Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",        // Password hashing
  "express-session": "^1.17.3", // Session management
  "connect-pg-simple": "^7.0.0" // PostgreSQL session store
}
```

## Security Features

1. **Password Security**
   - Passwords hashed with bcryptjs (10 salt rounds)
   - Never stored in plain text
   - Compared securely during login

2. **Session Security**
   - Sessions stored in PostgreSQL (not in memory)
   - 24-hour expiration
   - Secure cookie handling
   - CSRF protection ready

3. **Access Control**
   - Backend validation on all protected routes
   - Frontend UI hides unauthorized actions
   - Role-based permission checks

4. **Admin Protection**
   - Only 1 admin can exist
   - Admin cannot delete their own account
   - Admin creation requires database access initially

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Server
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Create First Admin User
Run SQL or Node script to create admin user (see QUICK_START.md)

### 4. Login
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
- Use admin credentials

### 5. Create More Users
- Go to Admin Dashboard
- Create users with different roles

## API Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Role | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------|------|---------|
| /login | GET | No | - | Show login page |
| /login | POST | No | - | Process login |
| /logout | GET | Yes | All | Logout user |
| /api/user-info | GET | Yes | All | Get current user |
| /api/users | GET | Yes | Admin | List users |
| /api/users/create | POST | Yes | Admin | Create user |
| /api/users/:id/role | POST | Yes | Admin | Change role |
| /api/users/:id | DELETE | Yes | Admin | Delete user |
| /admin-dashboard | GET | Yes | Admin | Admin panel |
| /add | POST | Yes | E/A | Add record |
| /edit/:id | POST | Yes | E/A | Edit record |
| /delete/:id | POST | Yes | E/A | Delete record |
| /upload | POST | Yes | E/A | Upload Excel |

**Legend:** E/A = Editor/Admin, Yes = Required, No = Not required

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install`
- [ ] Start server: `npm start`
- [ ] Create admin user in database
- [ ] Login with admin credentials
- [ ] Create Editor user from admin dashboard
- [ ] Create Viewer user from admin dashboard
- [ ] Login as Editor - verify can add/edit/delete
- [ ] Login as Viewer - verify cannot add/edit/delete
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Test role change from admin dashboard
- [ ] Test user deletion from admin dashboard
- [ ] Verify session expires after 24 hours
- [ ] Test accessing protected routes without login

## Performance Considerations

- Sessions stored in PostgreSQL for scalability
- Password hashing uses 10 rounds (balance between security & speed)
- Session expiration set to 24 hours
- All queries use parameterized statements (SQL injection safe)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Verification** - Verify email on user creation
2. **Password Reset** - Allow users to reset forgotten passwords
3. **Audit Logging** - Track user actions
4. **Two-Factor Authentication** - Add 2FA for admin accounts
5. **User Profiles** - Allow users to update their profile
6. **Activity Dashboard** - Show recent user activities
7. **API Keys** - Allow programmatic access
8. **Rate Limiting** - Prevent brute force attacks

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'bcryptjs'"
**Solution:** Run `npm install`

### Issue: "Connection refused" on login
**Solution:** Check PostgreSQL is running and DATABASE_URL is correct

### Issue: Admin dashboard not accessible
**Solution:** Verify you're logged in as Admin role

### Issue: Cannot create first admin
**Solution:** See QUICK_START.md for database setup
